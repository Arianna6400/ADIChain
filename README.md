## Introduction

Welcome to **ADIChain**, a decentralized DApp platform built on blockchain, designed to give a new prospective to the management of health information. ADIChain utilizes blockchain technology to ensure security, privacy, and accessibility of medical information, offering an innovative solution for doctors, patients and caregivers.

### Overview

ADIChain is a medical platform that facilitates effective and secure management of health data. Using Ethereum as the backbone for data security and immutability, and Python for offchain operations, ADIChain aims to improve communication between doctors and patients. This application is designed to allow doctors to manage medical reports and treatment plans efficiently, while patients, both autonomous and non-autonomous (assisted by caregivers), can access and view their medical information securely and privately.

> **Note:** ADI stands for *Assistenza Domiciliare Integrata*, as for *Integrated Home Care*

### Key Features

Our mission is to simplify the way medical information is managed and shared, prioritizing the security and privacy of data.
ADIChain is designed to be used both by healthcare professionals and patients and/or their caregivers. Here are listed some of the main functions:

- **Medical Report Management**: Doctors can create, manage, and share medical reports and treatment plans digitally in real-time.
- **Customized Treatment Plans**: Development of specific treatment plans for each patient, accessible by both doctors and patients or their caregivers.
- **Secure and Decentralized Access**: Thanks to the use of the blockchain technology, all information is protected against unauthorized changes, ensuring a secure and transparent environment.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Designed to be accessible and easy to use for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.

### Technologies Used to Develop
